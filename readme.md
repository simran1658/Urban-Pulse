# 🚦Urban Pulse – Quantum Optimized Vehicular Flow Synchronization Model

Urban Pulse is a traffic management system that automatically adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle density.
Using YOLOv2 (You Only Look Once) for object detection and a custom simulation engine, Urban Pulse dynamically allocates green-signal duration to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.

---
## 🚦 Project Overview

Traditional traffic lights follow fixed timers, causing unnecessary delays during low traffic and major congestion during peak hours.

### Urban Pulse solves this problem by :

* Detecting vehicles using YOLOv2

* Counting density in each lane

* Calculating smart signal times

* Simulating real-time signal switching

* Prioritizing high-density lanes

This ensures faster movement, shorter waiting times, and efficient junction management.
